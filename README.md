# 🪟 WNU — Windows’s Not Unix

**WNU** (*Windows’s Not Unix*) is a free software, mass‑collaboration project inspired by the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/), but built **for Windows first**.  
Our mission is to give Windows developers the same freedoms GNU brought to Unix users — the freedom to run, study, modify, and share their tools — without leaving their platform of choice.

---

## 🎯 Mission
WNU exists to:
- Develop a **Windows‑native compiler collection** and supporting tools.
- Provide **free software** alternatives to proprietary Windows developer utilities.
- Build a **community** where anyone can contribute code, documentation, or ideas.
- Keep all core components **open source** under a copyleft license.

---

## 🛠 Current Focus
- **WNU Compiler Collection** — starting with a C+ front‑end using a G++ backend.
- **Windows‑native core utilities** — GNU‑like tools adapted for Windows paths and APIs.
- **Developer tooling** — build systems, package managers, and libraries for Windows.

## 📜 The WNU Manifesto
Like GNU, WNU is more than just code — it’s a philosophy.
